We have identified the following drivers as most important to our project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Due to the time constraint on this project we wish to create an 	
	architecture which is as modifiable as possible, to allow quick iterations
	in development.
	\item A game of this nature needs to be balanced in such a way to keep it
	hard enough for seasoned players, and accessible to newcomers.  Thus we 
	wish to keep the architecture data-driven in all areas, allowing us to
	change constants and tweak difficulty quickly.
\end{itemize}
