\subsection{Developers}
Members:  Dag Øyvind Tornes, Sibte-Haider Syed, Robin Kåveland Hansen

Concerns: The developers primary concern is to create a game which is 
enjoyable, while still satisfying the course requirements, and receiving a
good grade.  Also, we would like to not work ourselves to death.

\subsection{Evaluators}
Members:  The ATAM team and teaching staff.

Concerns: The evaluators will be concerned with a cleanly designed and well
documented architecture, as this is their primary view of the game.  They will
probably also want to see an implementation in sync with the documentation.

\subsection{The players}
Members:  The development team, and other parties looking for a lot of fun.

Concerns:  The players will want a game which is easy to learn, and fun to
play.
