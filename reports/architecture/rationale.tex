Since our primary quality attribute is modifiability, we have aimed to create 
an architecture which allows us to make changes at a late date, without
affecting other parts of the code.

To achieve this, we have attempted to separate responsibilities, in such a way
that each module can be changed without breaking functionality in others.

We have also designed a modular entity system, using events to communicate, 
which should make adding new features much simpler.  All in all we hope these 
decisions will combine to make an extensible architecture.
