The project team only consisted of three members which severely impacted how much the team could manage to implement. During the implementation we learned that two more members were to join our team, but that did not seem to be true. We never heard from those members. We are very proud that we managed to produce so much as we did, given the size of the group.  

Illness was a problem for the project team. Absence of one member made a huge impact on the team. Luckily we did not to much of those, but it did make a huge impact every time. Due to all this, we have been forced to prioritize. We have focused more on the actual implementation, than revising the initial \emph{Architectural Description Document} and \emph{Requirements Description Document}. We have tried to focus more on this document and the code, convincing ourselves that we have learned from the feedback from the staff, even though we haven't addressed them all e.g. like COTS etc.   

The changes we did occurred have been mentioned in this document.
