This document is part of a final delivery in the course TDT4240 Software 
Architecture and is a part of total four documents:

This documents will discuss the implementation of our game called "Defense of 
the Guardian Gnome". We assume that the reader has read the \emph{Requirements 
Description Document} and \emph{Architecture Description Document} prior to 
reading this document. We will mainly focus on presenting the implementation, 
discussing it and testing it.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Requirements Description Document
	\item Architecture Description Document
	\item ATAM document
	\item Implementation Description Document (this document)
\end{itemize}

The main attribute for this group was \textbf{Modifiability}

For in-depth reading on the actual architecture of the game, we refer the
reader to our \emph{architecture description document}, and to the
\emph{requirements description documents} for the requirements. 

We were unfortunately unable to complete all the goals we had set for
ourselves. Some requirements were not completed, and we lacked time to
polish the game as much as we wanted. This was due to time-constraints,
and could also be attributed to slightly high expectations on our part.

We hope you enjoy our game !!
