This document is part of a final delivery in the course TDT4240 Software 
Architecture. The document will discuss the implementation of our game,
"Defense of the Guardian Gnome". The main focus of this document is to test
and provide a feedback / verdict on the actual implementation. 

For in-depth reading on the actual architecture of the game, we refer the
reader to our \emph{architecture description document}, and to the
\emph{requirements description documents} for the requirements. 

We were unfortunately unable to complete all the goals we had set for
ourselves. Some requirements were not completed, and we lacked time to
polish the game as much as we wanted. This was due to time-constraints,
and could also be attributed to slightly high expectations on our part.
