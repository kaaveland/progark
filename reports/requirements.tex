\section{Introduction}
This document describes the requirements that have been developed for \project,
a game developed for the XNA platform. It describes the functional requirements
and thus a high-level overview of how the game should play. There are also some
scenarios for content development that describe the quality requirements imposed
on the system. Chapter \ref{concepts} describes the concept behind the game on
a high level, as well as some discussion around some game design choices that
have been made at this time or will have to be made in the future. Chapter
\ref{funcreq} lays down the functional requirements that were decided on.
Chapter \ref{qualreq} deals with the quality requirements in detail, as well as
some scenarios that might be relevant for \project.
