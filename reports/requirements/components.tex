XNA is a Microsoft developed set of tools for developing games\cite{XNADEV}. It is available
primarily for the Microsoft Windows, Windows Mobile and Xbox 360 platforms, though
it has been ported to the cross-platform Mono framework\footnote{This project
appears to be mostly abandoned by now}.
It allows easy creation of both 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional games,
and supports audio and multiple input devices. It also supports many common data
formats for both visual and audio. Typically, one develops games for XNA with the
usage of one of the (So far) 5 revisions of XNA Game Studio.
