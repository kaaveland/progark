We are still very vague on many details regarding our game concept. For example,
we are not sure whether the goal should be just survival for as long as possible,
effectively making the game score-driven and impossible to actually beat. In a
case like this, it makes no sense to have an object to defend.

Whether to use maps at all, or to have a single everchanging map is also something
we haven't decided on. If the game was to be set in a space-setting, it would
make sense for obstacles to be moving around whereas that wouldn't make much sense
in a fantasy setting.
