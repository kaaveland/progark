The idea behind the game is to defend an object of great value, the \objective.
This object is contineously assailed by enemies, from here on out known as \emph{creeps}.
Creeps are fortunately not very intelligent, and so move in certain predetermined
paths toward the \objective, allowing players to intercept them and defeat them.
Once the \objective is destroyed, or the last creep defeated, the game ends.

Each player controls a \emph{hero} that defends against the creeps. Heroes gain
\emph{experience} upon defeating creeps, and eventually gain levels, and new abilities.
As heroes grow more powerful, so too do creeps.
