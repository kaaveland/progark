We could not meet during the first week of the ATAM process due to other commitments.
This was later rectified when we met in our own time, instead of the time allotted by
the course. The documents presented to us by the other group were not well-suited
for the ATAM process initially, and this was the main point of discourse during our
later meeting. Even so this made the ATAM procedure more difficult for us than
initially anticipated.
