			S1 & The choice to disregard Android usability guidelines affects
			     usability negatively.\\
			S2 & Using a data-driven approach to the UI makes modifications
			     easier.\\
			S3 & Consciously considering code quality positively affects
			     development time and modifiability.\\
			S4 & Using Factory Pattern should simplify adding new features
			     such as additional powerups and traps\\															
			S5 & MVC is well supported on the Android platform, and the
			     decision to use it should lighten developer load and
			     make the code cleaner and more modifiable.\\
			S6 & Using an already existing framework (Sheep) should
			     positively affect code modifiability by offering simple
			     points to hook features into.  It may however become a
			     limitation if it turns out to be a bad match for the
			     planned game.\\
		    S7 & Limiting the options in menu screens should keep understanding
		         the game easy, which positively affects usability.\\
		    S8 & The observer-observed pattern promotes decoupling of
		         cause and effect. By using it the architecture should be
		         more easily modifiable.\\
